# Single-product-stochastic-inventory-control
The aim of this repository is to find an optimal policy for the next problem:

  "Each month, the manager of a warehouse determines current inventory (stock on hand) of a single product. Based on this information, he decides whether or not to order additional stock from a supplier. In doing so, he is faced with a tradeoff between the costs associated with keeping inventory and the lost sales or penalties associated with being unable to satisfy customer demand for the product. The manager's objective is to maximize some measure of profit (sales revenue less inventory holding and ordering costs) over the decision-making horizon. Demand for the product is random with a known probability distribution." (M. Puterman, *Markov Decision Processes Discrete Stochastic Dynamic Programming*).
  
In *Robles_Taller_1_Optimizacion_Estocastica.pdf* you can find the solution (in Spanish) of the initial problem, as well as some implementation details and final analysis.
